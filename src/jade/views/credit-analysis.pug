                p.
                    It is important to understand the information on your <strong>credit report</strong> that could potentially affect your 
                    <strong>credit score</strong> negatively. For instance, there are certain parts that could be updated or removed to 
                    improve your score if you have already addressed the outstanding debt it refers to.

                p.
                    A <strong>credit analysis</strong> will give you a detailed breakdown of each account, its status, how it affects your <strong>credit profile</strong> and 
                    what can be done to improve it. This service is available at a <strong>nominal fee or R50.00</strong> and includes in-depth classification 
                    of the negative information on your profile.

                p.
                    A <em>credit check</em> is essentially a report from a registered credit bureau that shows which of your accounts are in arrears, 
                    which are paid up and if any of your accounts have judgments against it. 
                    You can contact any of the registered South African credit bureaus for an annual report free of charge. 
                    Once you have this information, you can then get in touch with Libertine Consultants to <em>request a credit analysis</em>.

                h2 Credit bureaus

                p.
                    A <strong>credit bureau</strong> is a historic record of how you <strong>manage your credit</strong> commitments. 
                    This information may either be positive or negative depending on how you have managed your accounts. 
                    The report given by the credit bureaus determine the final decision when a consumer applies for bond 
                    or any credit agreement, which is why this information is a matter of public record.
