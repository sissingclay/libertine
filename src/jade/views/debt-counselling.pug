                h2 What exactly is <em>debt counselling</em>?

                p.
                    Simply put, <strong>debt counseling</strong> is the process by which a qualified professional sits down with you to
                    analyse your <strong>budget and draw up a manageable repayment plan</strong> to settle your outstanding accounts.

                p.
                    To start with we'll compare your monthly income to your set monthly expenses to <strong>determine where
                    your money is going</strong> to and ensure that you are able to <strong>take care of yourself and your family</strong> while you
                    <strong>settle your debts</strong>.

            div(class='lb-content-constraint__large')

                p.
                    This gives us the necessary perspective to determine where we can make adjustments
                    to <strong>improve your cash flow</strong>. Once your budget has been finalised, we then look at how we will divide the
                    rest between your creditors.

                p.
                    The entire process of applying for <strong>debt counseling</strong> normally takes no longer than 60 working days and starts
                    with the completion of a form (Form 16), which allows Libertine Consultants to apply for a <strong>court order
                    on your behalf</strong> that allows us to <strong>restructure your debt repayments</strong>.
