                h2 What you should expect from the <em>debt review</em> process

                p.
                    <strong>Debt review</strong> is a dynamic process that requires absolute trust and honesty between the <strong>debt counsellor</strong>
                    and the individual seeking <strong>debt review</strong>. It is imperative that you divulge the information the counsellor
                    requires truthfully so they may correctly interpret your unique circumstances and <strong>provide the best
                    solution</strong>.

                p.
                    Once the counsellor has all the information they require they can then obtain updates balances from
                    your creditors, work out a payment proposal and start the <strong>debt review process</strong>. All you have to do
                    during this time is keep up with your payments* to the <a href="#{path + data.management.en.href}" class="lb-link">debt management company</a> appointed by your
                    counsellor.

                p.
                    The ideal result of a <em>debt review</em> is a court order that restructures your total debt obligations, resulting
                    in extended contractual terms and a <strong>single lowered monthly instalment</strong> paid via a registered payment
                    distribution agency. The agency then pays your creditors on your behalf according to the specifics of the
                    court order until such time that your <strong>debt is paid in full</strong> or you are caught up with the arrears and
                    capable of <strong>managing your own debt</strong>.

                p.
                    By partnering with our efficient, <strong>compassionate debt counsellors</strong> you'll ensure an open line of
                    communication that will result in a smooth debt management process and timely settlement of your
                    accounts.
