                Estate administration is an alternative to debt review that still qualifies as a formal process, but offers
                better protection against creditors' claims.

                p.
                    The main difference between debt counselling and estate administration* is that the latter is limited
                    with regard to the amount of debt that can go under administration. The total debt cannot exceed R50&nbsp;000,
                    although certain exceptions apply when garnishees are put under administration. Estate
                    administration is the most effective way to halt garnishees from your salary, as these are automatically
                    suspended while you are under administration.

                p.
                    Administration orders to not have to be a long term solution and once your financial situation improves
                    you can suspend the administration and manage your own finances once more.<br>
                    <small><em>*Please note that secured creditors, e.g. home and car financiers are exempt from estate administration
                    and you would still need to make provision for payments to these creditors in your monthly budget.</em></small>
